<h1>july2022 update</h1>

<p>woah, ive been inactive. silly of me after promising another death note post. i&rsquo;ll get back to that later. life has been a tailspin as like many youth my age. im going back to college this fall and will be moving at the end of the year.<br/>
but that junk aside whats been up man? haven&rsquo;t seen you in a while.<br/>
me? im good, just working on some projects. I can show you some stuff. infact ill show you a big post on 8/29.<br/>
in the meantime check out my <a href="../junk/haiku.html">haikus</a> man, theyre so cool (vapid).</p>

<p>interms of my tech stuff, i was on arch for quite a while but im back home on fedora and debian on my laptop.<br/>
trying some new stuff out aswell, running gnome wayland and im writing this on what i regret to inform you is the piece of terrorist software known as &ldquo;E-Macs&rdquo;.<br/>
heard some hackers use this? seems a little bloated, it has its own steam inside of it. I&rsquo;ll stick to my own unix philosophy software (said while using gnome), good ol&ndash;vim.<br/>
but for a project i have in the works im using a lot of markdown where i kind of need to navigate visually aswell as take screenshots to collaborate, so the vim syntax wasnt cutting it. i was using codium(fork of vscode) which has a v cute vim mode but has a very good and easy to use markdown preview.<br/>
i moved too emacs because i just dont like that codium is all js'ed up on a thurdsay afternoon. i think it runs on electron. but if it isn&rsquo;t it wouldn&rsquo;t change how i feel, which i think is true for many of us. electron is a bit of a scapegoat for our collective hate of obnoxious ui thats become standard in our age. while im not saying electron is good my point is only that electron is a symptom not the root problem.</p>

<p>before i leave, a quick list of things to come out next.<br/>
- jepy (my color scheme and files for its implementation in some software)<br/>
- my os list thing (just an install file for debian, fedora, and arch of my desktop setup)<br/>
- i have a project coming out on my birthday 8/29<br/>
- jinzo judge, a program for deck checking and making image previews.</p>

<p>anyways thats all for me, lov ya!
