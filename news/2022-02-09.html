<h1>boo! did linux scare you?</h1>

<p>so, long time no see. sorry for the silence, my exscuses are numerous but none are of quality. The main thing of note is that i've moved my main desktop machine to windows which has made it harder to do pretty much everything. so the website has been put on hiatus but im refreshing it now.</p>

<p>I've also been working on a movie, and im pretty happy. It's been the sum of a lot of my artistic experiace up to this point. I'm close to done with my first draft. It took a lot for me to just get a script first as the thing that haunts all my creative projects is scrapping really early on in the concecpt phase. I will be scarce on details because I want it to be a suprise, I will say that this will be an endevour taken almost solely by me: the only things i wont be able to contribute is voice acting and music.</p>

<p>besides the movie project i've been hard at work with college stuff, I'll be light on details. what i will say that as a big change from the majority of my school life I am doing well. I've been keeping good notes and writing things into my calander. Sadly though my mental state has been weary. Alot of my friends have been acting strange to me, and it's been piling onto some trust issues. Ontop of that my best friend moved away from me, and I only see like 6 people when I go on campus for classes so my face to face time has been lacking.</p>
