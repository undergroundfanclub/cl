<h1>today is cute</h1>

<p>read a cute <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/09/1062791738/americans-dont-feel-direct-payments-or-child-tax-credits-helped-them-new-poll-fi">NPR article</a></p>

<p>and it really challenged something in my world view. I was under the impression that people really liked the child tax credit, a pseudo UBI, though lapsed so maybe it was for not anyways. But like most things in life its more complicated.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave the sociologist to put together a narrative as to why people would be not warm to the CTC, but the more interesting thing to me after reading actually is democratic unity. I think a lot of messaging is about how polarised the US is and that&rsquo;s framed through a Democrat/Republican lense, but actually the Democratic party really is a stop gap here interms of getting things through. It&rsquo;s really pathetic that &ldquo;my party&rdquo; whatever that means is being held hostage by certain seats.</p>

<p>While ofcourse theres the conservative seats that we can&rsquo;t lose to republicans, i feel like a lot of this tug of war is with hyper proggressive not being able to settle. It&rsquo;s the worst part of politics is settling for the worse bill, but it&rsquo;s that or no bill.</p>

<p>Maybe analagous is &ldquo;harm reduction&rdquo; which a really weird framing that people latched onto. It really just is a comparitive statement. I feel like that&rsquo;s something humans are really good at, so it seems confusing to my soul that people seem to complicate those comparitve statements so much.</p>
