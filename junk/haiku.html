            <h1>brief</h1>
            <p>this page is a dedication to my haikus. this is a junkpage just meaning its not on the navbar and wont be updated with any priority. <br> I don't have much of a history with haikus, the first one post wasn't technically by me. it's story is listed underneath it. hope you think these are cute, theres not much else to 'em.</p>

	<h2>"poopy" (by oi) [02/22/2022]</h2>
	<p>the first haiku i had a touch in. based on a true story, i finished an exam and posted in a chat "Finished an exam Had to hold in a poop Not too happy". which my good friend oi took the initiative to convert to the haiku before you. which is really what set all this in motion.</p>

	<h2>"hotdog" [07/17/2022]</h2>
	<p>not much, i wrote it while playing in a yugioh tournament and eating a hotdog. the only note was the last line was originally was "haha very tasty" which my friend miles correctly noted wasn't 5 syllables and was edited and i had to shamefully delete the original tweet.</p>

	<h2>"trans woman's apartment" [07/27/2022]</h2>
	<p>this one isn't based in as much experiance, i simply feel like this what a lot of transwomen identify with. most trans women's apartments seem like old game consoles and being taken advantage of.</p>

	<h2>"bad vegan" [07/29/2022]</h2>
	<p>don't read much into or the title. im not a vegan myself and i simply ate pork rinds the morning. they were advertised as pork skins which isn't how i've usually head them called. but the name really had me thinking man what a uhm cruel and grotesque thing to eat: fried skin of our animal slaves.
