            howdy hodwy im a creature online in the space. a 20 something creator. I've been known for some comics ive drawn and some misc drawings.
        <br> i also created the first suicide boy fan server: a cute little manwha by illustrator parkgee <br>

        my favorite thing by far is the video game elder scrolls III: morrowind, and I hope that shows in the things that I create. Alien settings are so
        captivating.

<h1>boo! did linux scare you?</h1>

<p>so, long time no see. sorry for the silence, my exscuses are numerous but none are of quality. The main thing of note is that i've moved my main desktop machine to windows which has made it harder to do pretty much everything. so the website has been put on hiatus but im refreshing it now.</p>

<p>I've also been working on a movie, and im pretty happy. It's been the sum of a lot of my artistic experiace up to this point. I'm close to done with my first draft. It took a lot for me to just get a script first as the thing that haunts all my creative projects is scrapping really early on in the concecpt phase. I will be scarce on details because I want it to be a suprise, I will say that this will be an endevour taken almost solely by me: the only things i wont be able to contribute is voice acting and music.</p>

<p>besides the movie project i've been hard at work with college stuff, I'll be light on details. what i will say that as a big change from the majority of my school life I am doing well. I've been keeping good notes and writing things into my calander. Sadly though my mental state has been weary. Alot of my friends have been acting strange to me, and it's been piling onto some trust issues. Ontop of that my best friend moved away from me, and I only see like 6 people when I go on campus for classes so my face to face time has been lacking.</p>

<h1>magic the gathering</h1>

<p>if youre not interested in magic feel free to skip, im not going to slip in any interesting details.</p>

<p>I've been taking some off from magic, mostly after getting bummed out by my pet deck being blown out of modern. Dredge has struggled after faithless looting has been banened, so it's current state isnt suprising. I was just getting blown in the face of hyper efficient graveyard hate and how I feel on that is really complicated. </p>

<p>My first intuitive feeling is that it's sad that dredge is being beaten out while probably one of the best decks is still collosus hammer. Not that hammer time should be banned out, it's just to say that maybe the reticle on graveyard strategies doesn't feel coherent. The big thing right now is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/27/sanctifier-en-vec">sanctifier en-vec</a>, when ever my opponent drops it I have to concede. It nullifies all my interaction: bolts, pushes, everything. I dont have any green creatures that can deal damage. I'm simply not a good enough player to know why I see this card everytime im in every round past the first but it has pushed me out of dredge.</p>

<p>Enough about dredge, the main reason im writing this article is becuase of my new pet deck ive been brewing for a while. The older players may be familiar with this deck if youre really old in standard or more commonly in legacy for a short amount of time. It's <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uma/146/seismic-assault">Seismic Assault</a>! I started off just ripping other people's list through time, and stumbled on a late list by <a href="https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/wrennsixual-assault/">elpokitolama</a> that was very well established. A clean green red shell that was very optimized. Seismic Assault I feel is just what I need in this very heavy walker and creature meta. The satisfaction of picking off all the tiny mana efficient creatures fills me with un ending glee.</p>

<p>I've been experimenting with splashing blue, and that's where I feel this deck's strengths really come out. The deck has always been very controlly but I don't think has really embraced it, very briefly it was a <a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/budget-magic-77-46-tix-42-land-swan-hunt-modern">blue red combo deck</a>. But it has pretty conistantly been a control shell. Originally to embrace that I ran a suite of control options in green like Veil of Summer and guttural response to protect my key pieces. But they fell short, and the other short coming of the deck was card advantage. While arguably the greatest strength is that the deck can just loam each turn for 6 damage, it's a pretty weak gameplan because once you commit to it you won't be drawing anymore cards shorts of cycle lands and pain lands. So I'm splashing blue for hard counterspell and expressive iteration. Expressive iteration is such a crazy card period but goes bonkers in this deck. I'm also inheriting from Seismic Assault's brief time as a combo deck: trade routes, an enchantment for 1U that lets pick up lands and cycle them for a colorless. I'm not commited to trade routes, but has come in useful specifcally against control: though I don't think this card has a place in the sideboard. The last blue care I've experimented with is fire//ice a split card that gives a lot flexibility. I'm really scared to take out lightning bolts in favor of it, but it really does take up the same space as bolt. 2 damage divided vs to any target is a hard evaluation to make especially in this very volatile meta.</p>

<p>My decklist can be found <a href="https://deckstats.net/decks/142704/2360974-urg-loamcontrol">here</a>. I don't have a lot more to say other than urza's saga is a good card. I will probably be writing a better post once I have enough experiance to write a fleshed out primer for it.</p>
